# Containers:
### Provide the basic items you would need to add to a Dockerfile to create a container that could serve a “Hello world” static index.html page to a client over HTTPS (specific command lines aren’t needed, just the components required is fine)
### How would you configure a container build system or script for an application that uses several public artifacts, in such a way that you would not have to rely on public repositories to pull down those artifacts with each build?
### What are the pros and cons of running a replicated set of mysql databases with, or without, containerization?
### What is the underlying concept that differentiates containers from virtual machines?
